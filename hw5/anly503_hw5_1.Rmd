### 1. Explore all accounts

```{r}
accounts <- read.csv("data/accounts_analytical.csv")
transactions <- read.csv("data/transactions.csv")
```


```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
mean_balance <- merge(x = transactions, y = accounts, by = "account_id", all.x = TRUE) %>%
  select(c(account_id, balance)) %>%
  group_by(account_id) %>%
  summarise(mean_balance = mean(balance))
n_cards <- ifelse(is.na(accounts$credit_cards), 0, 1)
mean_balance$`Whether Account Has Credit Cards` <- as.factor(n_cards)
loan_binary <- ifelse(is.na(accounts$loan_amount), 0, 1)
mean_balance$`Whether Account Has Loan` <- as.factor(loan_binary)
```


```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggridges)

mean_balance$combined_categories <- as.factor(ifelse(mean_balance$`Whether Account Has Credit Cards` == 1, ifelse(mean_balance$`Whether Account Has Loan` == 1, "yes_credit_yes_loan", "yes_credit_no_loan"), ifelse(mean_balance$`Whether Account Has Loan` == 1, "no_credit_yes_loan", "no_credit_no_loan")))

ggplot(mean_balance, 
       aes(x = mean_balance, 
           y = combined_categories, 
           fill = combined_categories)) +
  geom_density_ridges() + 
  theme_ridges() +
  labs("Highway mileage by auto class") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

All types of accounts are left skewed. Accounts with no credit cards but with loans have a higher average balance compared to the other types of accounts.
