### 2. Distribution of all loans

```{r}
accounts <- read.csv("data/accounts_analytical.csv")
transactions <- read.csv("data/transactions.csv")
loans <- accounts[, grepl( "loan" , names(accounts))]
loans <- na.omit(loans)
```


```{r}
library(caret)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
loans %>% 
  select(c("loan_amount", "loan_payment", "loan_term", "debit_bank_transfer_loan_payment_txn_ct", "debit_bank_transfer_loan_payment_txn_tot", "debit_bank_transfer_loan_payment_avg_txn", "loan_default")) %>%
  gather(key = "variable", value = "value", -one_of("loan_default")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = value, color=loan_default)) +
    geom_density() +
    facet_wrap(~variable, scales = 'free') 
```

This visualization shows default and non-default loans for all the numerical variables regarding loans. We can see that loan amounts are left-skewed whereas loan term are more uniformally distribured.
