This portfolio contains the data visualizations I've made while taking ANLY503 Data Vis class at Georgetown in Fall 2020. It includes **four coding assignments** and a **final project**. 

The final project tells a story about the **$\color{crimson}{\text{Covid-19 development timeline in different countries}}$** around the world. 

* The visualizations include 
- regular tabular data
- text data
- network data
- time series data. 

The programming languages include Python and R. Checkout the repository for source code: https://github.com/anly503/anly503-fall2020-project-zlds123
