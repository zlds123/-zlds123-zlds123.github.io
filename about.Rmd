This portfolio contains the data visualizations I've made while taking ANLY503 Data Vis class at Georgetown in Fall 2020. It includes four coding assignments and a final project that shows a story about the Covid-19 development timeline in different countries. 

The visualizations include regular tabular data, text data, network data, and time series data. The programming languages are Python and R.
